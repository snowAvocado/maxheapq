# binary heap

This project implements heap data structure, specifically max binary heaps described on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap#Building_a_heap)

The purpose is to implement my own version and compare with 
already existing [heapq](https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html)
