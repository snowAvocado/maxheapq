# binary heap

This project implements heap data structure, specifically both min and max binary heaps described on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap#Building_a_heap)

The purpose is to implement my own version and compare with 
already existing [heapq](https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html)

## Highlights

1. Includes implementation for both min-heap and max-heap

2. Includes unit tests

3. Publish module to Python Package Index (PyPI). (planned)
